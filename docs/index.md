# Documentation
This module provides the scala doc documentation. The module tree is accessible on the right-hand side.
We also provide ReadMe files in the SANSA-Stack Github project. The Github project is available [here](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack).
## Layers
The SANSA project is structured in the following five layers developed in their respective sub-folders:
* RDF [readme](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/blob/develop/sansa-rdf/README.md), [package](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/tree/develop/sansa-rdf)
* OWL [readme](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/blob/develop/sansa-owl/README.md), [package](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/tree/develop/sansa-owl)
* Query [readme](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/blob/develop/sansa-query/README.md), [package](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/tree/develop/sansa-query)
* Inference [readme](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/blob/develop/sansa-inference/README.md), [package](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/tree/develop/sansa-inference)
* Machine Learning [readme](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/blob/develop/sansa-ml/README.md), [package](https://github.com/SANSA-Stack/SANSA-Stack/tree/develop/sansa-ml)


## Paper Specific Documentation
For recently published papers, we provide here a fast entry point to the provided modules. All of those modules are as well accessible over the standard documentation
